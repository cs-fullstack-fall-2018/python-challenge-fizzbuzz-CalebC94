FIZZBUZZ Milestone challenge

FIZZBUZZ is the classic Programmer's challenge often used as part of job interviews. 

User inputs the ending value (e.g. 100)
Create a new file called 'fizzbuzz.txt'

# Your code should start at 1 and then iterate each number up to the maximum
* If the current number is evenly divisible by 3 you should print "FIZZ" and the number
* If the current number is evenly divisible by 5 you should print "BUZZ" and the number
* If the current number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 you should print "FIZZBUZZ" and the number BOTH to the screen and to the file 'fizzbuzz.txt'
* Otherwise, just print the number
